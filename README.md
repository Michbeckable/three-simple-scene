# three-simple-scene

Basic repo to provide a simple 3d scene using [three.js](http://threejs.org/). So far it includes the following items:
* a three.js scene showing a cube on a floor plane
* camera control for orbit, pan, zoom controlled by mouse
* lighting with spot light and shadows enabled

Fork this repo if you are about to test some features in a simple WebGL rendering environment using three.js or if you want to build up something bigger and don't want to start from scratch.
